# Hedge Fund replication
Description:<br/>
This project tries to replicate hedge funds returns by using genetic algorithm to find optimal assets from a set of about 4000 assets for training the linear regression model and then displaying the best match and accuracy for returns after testing the data.<br/>
Based on the paper "Hedge fund replication with a genetic algorithm:breeding a usable mousetrap" by Brian C.Payne and Jiri Tresl.
